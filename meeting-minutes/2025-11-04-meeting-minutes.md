# Discusstion
- Be able to utilize chunk idea in aflsmart, but must be implemented it for specific PDF format.
- Analyze the PDF format to prioritize objects in PDF format that should be targeted more often for delete/add/splice operations.
- AFLSmart is a good paper to dive deeper into in the future.
- PDF readers are widely used, so they are a good attack vector; discovering zero-day vulnerabilities in PDF readers would be useful.
# Todo
- Keep reading and collecting ideas from papers on fuzzing of structured/formatted inputs (2–3 papers per week), especially those related to PDF fuzzing.
