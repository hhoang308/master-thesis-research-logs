## Log
### The LibAFL Fuzzing Library
#### crates
- LibAFL is composed of different crates which is an individual library.
- `crates` list:
    - `libafl`: main crate, contains all the components needed to build a fuzzer.
        - choose features flags, some are already set by default:
            - `std`: enables the parts of the code that use the Rust standard library, only disables if you intent to use LibAFL in embedded environments.
            - `llmp_bind_public`: bind to a public TCP port, allows other fuzzers node can communicate with this instance.
            - `introspection`: adds performance statistics to LibAFL
    - `libafl_bolts`: contains useful low-level rust features.
        - `core_affinity`: bind curent process to cores.
