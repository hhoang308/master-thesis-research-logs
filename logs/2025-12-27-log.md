## Task
#### Install WinAFL with DynamoRIO
1. `git clone -r https://github.com/googleprojectzero/winafl`
2. Install DynamoRIO release for Windows and unzip
3. Install Visual Studio
4. Install `desktop development with C++` packages. This package includes MSVC Compiler, Windows SDK (headers, library, debuggers, documents,...) and build tools (CMake and MSBuild).
5. Open `x86 Native Tools Command Prompt`
   1. This terminal will run a script to reconfig environment variables, so that this terminal will use 32 bit compiler runs on this Windows 64 bit machine to generate 32 bit binary executable files (.exe).
   2. Windows 64 bit (x64) can run both 64 bit and 32 bit software applications (based on WOW64)
   3. Only 32 bit application can load 32 bit library. AcroRd32.exe is 32 bit so that winafl.dll must be 32 bit, then AcroRd32.exe can load this library.
6. `cmake -G "Visual Studio 18 2026" -A Win32 .. -DDynamoRIO_DIR=D:\DynamoRIO-Windows-11.90.20444\DynamoRIO-Windows-11.90.20444\cmake`
   1. Create project for `Visual Studio 18 2026`
   2. Architecture 32 bit
7. `cmake --build . --config Release`
#### Fuzzing an arbitrary application with WinAFL (without DynamoRIO)
for example: gdiplus.dll
